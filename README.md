# Carmen's .OBJ loader

This is a fun project I did to familiarize myself with the underlying WebGL API, and better understand the relationshi between WebGL, GLSL, etc. Also this is a first deep dive into typescript.

You can se the relationship between the different vertices loaded in. A .OBJ file is just a text file with a list of position, normal, and UV values that make up the model. 

To better see this relationship, I've added the ability to manipulate the color of the model, which leverages these positions. Play around!

Also, you can add an an image and that will apply a texture. The Pirate girl example file shows how a properly textured model works.

## TODO
Refactoring. I was so excited to get this project finished that I definitely neglected some DRY principles. Will be revisiting this soon.
